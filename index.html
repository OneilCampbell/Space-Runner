        <h3>Mission:</h3>

        <br>

        <p id="gameplay">
            The supply ship that was sent to you, collided with an asteroid belt, and was destroyed; scattering
            the food everywhere. Those provisions are crucial to your survival. Therefore you must navigate
            through the asteroid field and collect as much as you can; ideally around 1000 lbs of provisions is necessary for sustenance.
            Be forewarned: Your ship can only sustain so much damage, before it is destroyed, but it is understood that the asteroid field 
            is unpredictable so try to collide with as few asteroids as possible.
